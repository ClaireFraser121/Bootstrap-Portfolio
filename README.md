# Bootstrap Portfolio

Welcome to my Bootstrap-powered portfolio webpage! This project is part of an assignment that focuses on creating a portfolio layout using the Bootstrap CSS Framework from scratch. It showcases my skills in HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap.

## Introduction

In this assignment, I've used Bootstrap to create a professional and visually appealing portfolio website. This webpage serves as a platform to display my work, skills, and provide information about myself. As I continue my journey in web development, this portfolio will evolve to showcase my progress and future projects.

## Description

### UX and Advanced CSS

Throughout this project, I have learned a wide range of web development skills, including HTML, CSS, GitHub, GitHub Pages, and Bootstrap. It's a culmination of knowledge and practice that enables me to create a user-friendly and responsive portfolio. The use of Bootstrap has allowed me to enhance the site's design and layout efficiently.

### Commitment to Learning

An essential aspect of this assignment has been an emphasis on maintaining a healthy commit history on GitHub. Committing often has not only ensured that my work is saved but also reflects my active engagement in learning and coding. Considering the principle of "commit early and often" to track code progression and provide an opportunity to revert if needed.

### Instructions

Here's a summary of the steps taken to complete this project:

1. Created a new GitHub repository named **Bootstrap-Portfolio**.
2. Cloned the repository to my computer.
3. Structured the project with the following elements:
    - `index.html`
    - `CSS` folder with `style.css`
    - `images` folder for all project images
4. Utilized Bootstrap to design the portfolio, which includes:
    - A navigation bar with links to portfolio sections.
    - A hero section featuring a jumbotron with a picture and personal information.
    - A work section that showcases projects with descriptions.
    - A skills section listing the skills I expect to learn.
    - An about/contact section that provides an introduction and contact information.
    - A footer with hyperlinks and hover effects on buttons.
5. Minimized the use of media queries by using Bootstrap's responsive features.
6. Deployed the portfolio to GitHub Pages to make it accessible online.

I'm excited to share my web development journey through this portfolio and am looking forward to the upcoming units, where we'll delve into JavaScript to further enhance my coding skills.
